					<span>Whiles in the early Winter eve</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We pass amid the gathering night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some homestead that we had to leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Years past; and see its candles bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shine in the room beside the door</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where we were merry years agone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now must never enter more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As still the dark road drives us on.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eâ€™en so the world of men may turn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At even of some hurried day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And see the ancient glimmer burn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across the waste that hath no way;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then with that faint light in its eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A while I bid it linger near</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nurse in wavering memories</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bitter-sweet of days that were.</span>
